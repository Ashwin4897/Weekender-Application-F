            <li>Ashwin: Born in San Jose, CA. I have been software-concentrated for 2 years now with a focus in GIS, having had some experience in web app development and map construction through GIS tools. I spend my time honing my skills through school work and personal coding missions. My goal is to one day create some form of software that ends up benefiting humans on a large scale, I have not been able to decide on anything more specific thus far. </li>

            <li>Anthony: I am from Gardena, CA in Los Angeles county, and I have been in Arizona for about 6 ½ years. I originally started my studies as a computer software engineer and transitioned into the Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in Computer Informatics and Digital Culture. After graduation I plan on pursuing a career in software development. Outside of school, I love basketball, video games and music.  When I am not doing any of those things I’m with my friends enjoying a chill Arizona afternoon or messing around with my dog Reese. </li>
